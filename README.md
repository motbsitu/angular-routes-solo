Angular-Routes-Solo
Hey everybody!

In this assignment we will be using Angular Routes to display information on 3 fictional characters of your choice. Your page should have a header and footer of some kind, and 3 buttons to swap out the content of the characters.

Sample Characters

Harry Potter (Harry Potter books/movies)
Storm (X-Men)
Frodo (Lord of the Rings)
Samus Aran (Metroid)
Indiana Jones (movies)
Michonne (Walking Dead)
Content
Feel free to use Google for the content or make up your own! Include some images and give it your best styling effort.

Hard Mode
Use ng-show, ng-hide, or ng-if to add some dynamic elements to your views when users click on things.

Pro Mode
Make the whole experience responsive with media queries or by using a library such as Bootstrap.
