<p>
  Armand is a fictional character in The Vampire Chronicles novels written by Anne Rice.
  At the end of the series, he is approximately 500 years of age. His outward appearance
  is that of a beautiful adolescent boy, small, with reddish-brown locks, soft brown eyes
  and slender fingers. His features are at times compared figuratively to those of
  Cupid or a Botticelli angel.
