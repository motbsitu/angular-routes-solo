Physical appearance:
Lestat describes himself as six feet tall. He has blond hair that is not quite shoulder
length, and that is rather curly, which sometimes appears white under fluorescent lighting.
His eyes are gray, but they reflect the colors of blue or violet easily from surfaces around
them. He has a short narrow nose, and a mouth that is well shaped, but has always been slightly
large for his face. His mouth can look very mean or extremely generous, but always sensual.
He has a continuously animated face. Lestat's fingernails (like those of all vampires in The
Vampire Chronicles) look like they are made of glass.
